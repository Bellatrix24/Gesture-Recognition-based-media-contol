# **Introduction**

Welcome to our Gesture Recognition System, a project designed to interact with your computer using hand gestures. This system allows users to control music playback functions and other actions with simple hand movements, providing an intuitive and efficient way to interact with their devices.

# **Features**

Hand Gesture Control: The system detects various hand gestures using a webcam and processes them in real-time.

Music Playback Control: Users can play, pause, skip to the next track, and return to the previous track with specific hand gestures.

Intuitive Interface: Gestures are designed to be intuitive and easy to remember, enhancing the user experience.

Customizable: The system can be customized to recognize additional gestures or perform different actions based on user preferences.

# **How it Works**
The Gesture Recognition System utilizes computer vision techniques to detect hand gestures in the webcam feed. Once a gesture is recognized, it triggers the corresponding action on the computer. For example, making an "okay" gesture can pause or play music, while showing a "thumbs up" gesture can skip to the next track. The system provides real-time feedback, making interaction seamless and responsive.

# **Getting Started**
To use the Gesture Recognition System, follow these steps:

1) Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer, along with the necessary libraries such as OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI.

2)Clone the Repository: Download the repository containing the Gesture Recognition System code.

3)Run the Code: Open the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the code, and run the main script.

4)Interact with Gestures: Once the webcam feed is displayed, start making hand gestures in front of the camera to control music playback and other actions.
